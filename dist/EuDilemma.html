    <h1>Make Your Choice</h1>
    <p>Hi. It seems that you are from the EU. Due to the relevent laws and regulations in your district, we are legally unable to serve you. But you have a choice.</p>
    <p>If you click "I Agree", you agree to the following claim:
    <ul>
        <li>I know there is no reliable way to protect my privacy once I am online.</li>
        <li>I know there is no reliable way to delete a piece of information once it is on the Internet.</li>
        <li>I know some PIIs, including my IP addresses, have to be sent to the servers and stored in the RAM so they can send the information I requested back to me.</li>
        <li>I know visiting a website means interpreting and executing the website's code on your local computer. The code may use any resources allowed by your browser, and store whatever it want as long as the browser allows. There is no reliable way to distinguish "good" code and "malicious" code.</li>
        <li>I agree that the Internet society should not and can not follow orders or rules from any regional politics group.</li>
        <li>I am object to any laws or regulations that is oppose to the claims above. I will break these laws if needed.</li>
    </ul>
    Thus we can continue serving you.</p>
